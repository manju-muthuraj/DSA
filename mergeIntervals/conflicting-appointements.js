/*
Problem Statement #
Given an array of intervals representing â€˜Nâ€™ appointments, find out if a person can attend all the appointments.

Example 1:
Appointments: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

Example 2:
Appointments: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: true
Explanation: None of the appointments overlap, therefore a person can attend all of them.

Example 3:
Appointments: [[4,5], [2,3], [3,6]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since [4,5] and [3,6] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

Solution #

The problem follows the Merge Intervals pattern. We can sort all the intervals by start time and then check if any two intervals overlap.
A person will not be able to attend all appointments if any two appointments overlap

        if (intervals[i].start < intervals[i - 1].end) {
            // please note the comparison above, it is "<" and not "<="
            // while merging we needed "<=" comparison, as we will be merging the two
            // intervals having condition "intervals[i][start] === intervals[i - 1][end]" but
            // such intervals don't represent conflicting appointments as one starts right
            // after the other
            return false;
        }

    return true;
